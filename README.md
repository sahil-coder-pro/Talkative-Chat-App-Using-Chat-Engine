# Talkative

Description - 
This project is a chat application featuring a React frontend and a Node.js backend. We utilize ChatEngine to manage chat functionalities, allowing for seamless one-on-one and group chats. ChatEngine abstracts away the complexities of socket logic, providing a straightforward interface for real-time messaging.

How to Use the App
1. Create a Username: Start by creating a unique username to enter the chat application.

2. Search for Users: Use the search feature to find other users. If the users exist, they will appear in the search results.

3. Start Chats: You can initiate one-on-one chats with individual users or select multiple users to create group chats.

This setup enables efficient communication through both personal and group interactions, leveraging the robust capabilities of ChatEngine.
